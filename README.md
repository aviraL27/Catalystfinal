## About  
Catalyst is a student-focused web portal built by **Team Cypher** for the community of **IIIT Nagpur**.  
Our goal was simple â€” to make campus life smoother by bringing together everything students need in one place.  

From tracking complaints and checking announcements to managing hostel-related issues, Catalyst keeps it all organized and accessible through a clean, modern interface.

## Project  
The platform lets students:  
- Register and monitor their complaints or issues.  
- Check whatâ€™s pending, in progress, or resolved.  
- Stay updated with campus notices and announcements.  

Itâ€™s a project made with care, teamwork, and the belief that small digital improvements can make a big difference on campus.
